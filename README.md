# AI-Bring-Character-To-Life
create a character who stays consistent throughout different prompts. My goal is to create a "story" around this characters life.

The character will be realistic, ultra-detailed, often times semi-nude and always look like the life of a real person.

I've already got the character I want to use, and want to place her in different clothes and locations, doing different poses and stuff.

However, I cannot seem to keep certain features of her consistent nor get her bust size big enough without faceswapping from a large busted woman. I've been using Leonardo.ai paid plan and its done a great job in creating the character, but keeping bust size, or posing in certain ways I'm finding it doesn't do very well. Then comes the clothing side of things, I feel Leonardo.ai doesn't do a very good job with clothing prompts when using "Image Guidance" as they all stay the same color as the image you want to style from.

I've been pulling my hair out trying to find a way to create a really interesting story based on my AI character.

I'd also like to eventually create short motion videos as well.

Open to use other tools to do ALL of this, as long as I can use my current character somehow.

I would also like to add that this WILL eventually involve ADULT content. So if we can have a solution for that as well than that would be huge!
=====================
Creating a character that stays consistent across different prompts, poses, and settings, while ensuring that features like bust size and clothing remain accurate, is a complex task. However, several strategies and tools can be used to help you achieve this goal. Below are some suggestions and possible solutions to help maintain consistency with your character, as well as tools to manage the character's story, features, clothing, and eventual video creation.
Key Challenges and Solutions:

    Consistency of Character Features (e.g., bust size, face, etc.)

        Solution: Use a Stable Base Image and Layered Prompts
            For consistency in appearance, you should always use the same "base image" of the character. By doing so, AI models can reference this base image to maintain certain key features like facial features, body type, and bust size.
            You can use Image Guidance with detailed instructions for things like the bust size, facial structure, etc. To ensure the AI doesn't change these aspects, be sure to specify these characteristics in the prompt, and mention them consistently across all prompts.

        Tools to Use:
            Stable Diffusion: A highly customizable model that allows for more detailed prompts and input. Using a pre-generated image as input with image-to-image guidance (image inpainting) can help preserve the character’s look. You can control body proportions, facial features, and pose without causing drastic changes.
            Artbreeder: This tool allows you to adjust specific features like facial features, bust size, body proportions, and more. By saving these settings, you can keep the character consistent.

    Clothing Customization

        Solution: Layer Clothing Descriptions and Use Multiple Tools
            While AI models like Leonardo.ai might struggle with clothing, you can improve the results by breaking down your clothing descriptions into smaller parts. Be explicit about materials, colors, and styles, and try to specify them as separate layers.
            Image-to-Image techniques can help you take the base image and adjust the clothing separately in subsequent images. This method allows for custom clothing to be added while retaining the character's consistency.
            You could also use AI-assisted fashion tools to design and modify clothing specifically for your character.

        Tools to Use:
            RunwayML: A platform that provides various AI models, including those for generating clothing and accessories. You can create and modify clothing styles by layering prompts or using image-to-image features.
            Daz3D: For creating characters in 3D, Daz3D can offer much more control over clothing, textures, and poses, and you can save your characters for future use. Clothing can be customized and modeled onto the character in ways that are consistent and detailed.

    Posing and Consistency

        Solution: Use Pose Libraries or 3D Software for Control
            AI-generated models can sometimes have inconsistent posing, especially when using image-to-image guidance. For more control over posing, you could use 3D software to pose your character in specific positions, which you can then render or convert into 2D images. This helps ensure the character's consistency across different settings.
            For static images, you can adjust the pose in a detailed manner using more specific prompts or by adjusting the skeleton (in the case of 3D models).

        Tools to Use:
            Blender: A free 3D software that can generate realistic models, poses, and animations. You can import your character into Blender, pose it in different ways, and render it in various environments.
            Poser: A 3D software specifically designed for human character modeling and posing. Poser allows for detailed control over character appearance and pose, which you can then export as images.

    Motion Videos and Animation

        Solution: Use 3D Models or AI-Assisted Animation Software
            To create short motion videos or animations, you need either a 3D model of your character or a tool capable of animating 2D images in a way that makes them appear to move.
            Tools like DeepMotion (AI-driven motion capture) and RunwayML can help you animate a 2D or 3D character. These tools let you upload your character and animate it using motion capture or pose tracking techniques.

        Tools to Use:
            DeepMotion: You can create lifelike animations for your character using AI-driven motion capture. Upload videos of movements (or use pre-existing motion data) to animate the character.
            Reallusion iClone: This is another tool for animating 3D models. It offers a wide range of controls over character movement, facial expressions, and more.
            Live2D Cubism: This tool allows you to animate 2D characters, giving them a realistic sense of motion. This could work well if you want to keep your character's style in 2D but need to animate it.

    Handling Adult Content

        Solution: Customize AI Models to Handle Adult Content Appropriately
            While some AI tools have content filters for adult material, you can adjust the prompts or use specific AI models that are trained to generate adult content. However, be aware that certain platforms may prohibit adult content, so you'll need to check their terms of service.
            You can also use Stable Diffusion or similar models where you can manually adjust the generated image by specifying adult features while respecting ethical guidelines and community standards.

        Tools to Use:
            Stable Diffusion (Custom Models): Custom-trained models or fine-tuning can be used to generate more tailored adult content while keeping it consistent with your character. This can be done through platforms like Hugging Face or custom installations of Stable Diffusion.
            NovelAI: This AI platform can be used to generate detailed, consistent, and semi-nude characters for storytelling. Be sure to check the terms of service and content policies if you're working with adult material.

Summary of Workflow

    Character Consistency: Use Stable Diffusion, Artbreeder, or Daz3D to create a base image and maintain consistency. Use image-to-image techniques to preserve the character’s features like bust size and pose.
    Clothing Customization: Utilize platforms like RunwayML or Daz3D for clothing design. Use descriptive prompts to guide the AI to create custom outfits that fit your character.
    Posing: Use 3D software like Blender, Poser, or iClone to control posing and character movements.
    Motion Videos: For animation, consider tools like DeepMotion, Reallusion iClone, or Live2D Cubism to animate the character in different poses and environments.
    Adult Content: Use platforms like Stable Diffusion or NovelAI, adjusting the models to accommodate adult content while following ethical guidelines and content regulations.

Final Notes:

Creating a story around your character, while keeping everything consistent, is possible with the right tools and techniques. Start with a strong character base, and use multiple AI and 3D tools to refine their appearance, clothing, poses, and animation. With persistence and iteration, you can build a compelling narrative around your AI-generated character.
